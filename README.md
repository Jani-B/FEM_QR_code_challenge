# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## About challenge! ðŸ‘‹

On this challenge I had to follow design given in Figma file. 
Very basic challenge.

On this challenge there was need to use only HTML and CSS. All pictures and colors were given on the project challenge.

## Most important challenges

One of the most important challenge on this one was to follow the figma file. 
There was not that many moving objects and as the margin on top is fixed it will follow bot desktop and mobile. 

I did not make different layout for mobile as there is so little on the page.
